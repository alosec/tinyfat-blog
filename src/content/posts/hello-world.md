Welcome to the TinyFat blog.

This is where we'll share updates on building TinyFat — managed hosting for AI agents that need persistent connections.

## What is TinyFat?

TinyFat provides always-on Docker containers for AI agents. While serverless is great for stateless workloads, AI agents often need:

- **Persistent WebSocket connections** (WhatsApp, Telegram, Slack)
- **Long-running processes** that maintain state
- **Direct API access** without cold start latency

We handle the infrastructure so you can focus on building your agent.

## Two Tiers

**tiny** — Shared VPS hosting. Your agent runs in an isolated Docker container alongside neighbors. Simple, affordable, always-on. ~$50/month.

**FAT** — Dedicated Hetzner box. True isolation for compliance or enterprise needs. Self-hosted inference option. ~$200+/month.

## What's Next

We'll be sharing:

- Technical deep-dives on the architecture
- Customer stories and use cases
- Product updates and new features
- Occasional investor updates (marked separately)

Stay tuned.
