Telegram is now a supported channel. Send your agent a message from Telegram and get a response — same brain, same memory, different interface.

This is an alpha. Reach out to hello@tinyfat.com to get set up.

## How It Works

- Message your agent's Telegram bot
- It responds in the same conversation thread

Same persistent memory and tools as web chat and email. The agent knows which channel you're using and formats responses accordingly.

## What's Next

- Slack integration
